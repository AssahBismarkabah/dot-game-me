# Dots and Boxes Game

Dots and Boxes is a classic pencil-and-paper game for two players (though it can also be played with more). Originally conceptualized by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas in the 19th century, it has been known by various names including "la pipopipette", dots and dashes, game of dots, dot to dot grid, boxes, and pigs in a pen.
How to Play

    The game starts with an empty grid of dots.
    Players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots.
    When a player completes the fourth side of a 1×1 box, they earn one point and take another turn.
    Points are typically recorded by placing a mark identifying the player in the box, such as an initial.
    The game ends when no more lines can be placed.
    The winner is the player with the most points.

# Board Size

    The board can be of any size grid.
    For beginners or quick games, a 2×2 board (3×3 dots) is suitable.
    Experienced players may prefer a larger grid, such as a 5×5 board.
